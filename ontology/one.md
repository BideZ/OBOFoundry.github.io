Nutritional epidemiology is a specific research area. The generic ontologies for food science, nutrition science or medical science failed to cover the specific characteristics of nutritional epidemiologic studies. As a result, we developed the ontology for nutritional epidemiology (ONE) in order to describe nutritional epidemiologic studies accurately.
