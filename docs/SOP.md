# Standard Operating Procedures

## New Ontology Requests (NOR) 

1. When receiving a new ontology request (NOR) issue request, thank the submitter for their submission.
1. The OBO dashboard curator adds the new submission to the NOR dashboard, which is deployed at https://obofoundry.github.io/obo-nor.github.io/
1. After the dashboard is run, the OBO dashboard curator informs the submitter about the need to fix the issues revealed by the dashboard, noting this is not part of the review itself, just a precursor, and that upon completion, a reviewer will be assigned.
1. At the next OBO operations call, a NOR shepherd is volunteered to be responsible for the issue. This shepherd familiarizes herself with the new ontology request and rallies the appropriate people to provide feedback.
1. At the next OBO operations call after that one, the NOR shepherd presents the NOR to the OBO operations committee and answered question. In most cases, the information provided will be sufficient to either grant or refuse the prefix request. In some cases, the OBO operations committee may choose to postpone their decision to require some clarification and fixes from the submitter.after that one, the NOR shepherd presents the NOR to the OBO operations committee and answered question.
