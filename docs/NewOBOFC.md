# Becoming a member of the OBO Foundry Operations Committee (OFOC)

Note: This is _not_ a formal process, but rather a piece of documentation to make the current _informal_ process more transparent. 

1. If someone (applicant) is interested in becoming a member of the operations group, they should contact an existing group member, 
who explains to them that the various duties expected from members of the OFOC (e.g. chairing calls, addressing issues on GitHub, joining a working group).
2. The applicant confirms they are willing to take up some of these duties.
3. The current members are then asked via an email on obo-operations if anyone objects to adding the candidate member. 
4. If conflicts/concerns arise, we try to first find consensus at the next OFOC call. 
5. In cases where no consensus can be reached, we ask for a formal vote with the majority of active members
6. If consensus is reached to admit the applicant, the existing group member that was contacted (or another obo-operations member) will notify the applicant by email. 

Note that new members are strongly encouraged to  become members of one of the subcommittees: [Editorial Working Group](https://obofoundry.org/docs/EditorialWG.html)
 or [Technical Working Group](https://obofoundry.org/docs/TechnicalWG.html).
