#Â My ontology is not ready for OBO Foundry, can I reserve a namespace anyway?

If your ontology is not eligible for inclusion in the OBO Foundry you can not directly reserve a namespace in the OBO Foundry. 
However, if you want to make sure that no one uses your prefix, you can [register your prefix at the Bioregistry](https://github.com/biopragmatics/bioregistry/issues/new/choose).
The updated [OBO policy on IDs](https://obofoundry.org/id-policy) ensures that new prefix requests must not clash with existing prefixes registered at the Bioregistry.
