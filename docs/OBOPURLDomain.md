The [OBO ID Policy](http://www.obofoundry.org/docs/Policy_for_OBO_namespace_and_associated_PURL_requests.html) describes requirements for requesting a new PURL.

Every ontology in OBO has a PURL, each version has a PURL, and every class also gets a PURL. The PURLs for ontologies can be found on individual ontology home pages.

For technical details of how the OBO PURL system works, and the format of individual purls, refer to https://github.com/OBOFoundry/purl.obolibrary.org/.
