title: Responsiveness (principle 17)
---

NOTE
-------
The wording of this principle is still in progress.

Summary and Purpose
-------
Ontology developers, curators and maintainers need to be responsive to community requests on their respective trackers (e.g. GitHub, Bitbucket and GitLab, etc).

[This check is automatically validated.](checks/fp_017)

Implementation
-------
Tickets, including new term requests and bug reports, are fundamental to open science initiatives such as OBO. Writing any ticket takes time, but writing good tickets can be a serious amount of work that is often overlooked - many of our ontologies simply would not continue to evolve without them. It is therefore imperative that issues are treated with great care. The OBO Foundry offers the following recommendations on the responsiveness in issue trackers.

1. Issues are contributions - and should be met by a thankful attitude. When receiving a ticket on your issue tracker, the first thing you should do is thanking the contributor.
1. Even if you can't deal with a ticket right away, offer your thanks, and explain when you plan to look at the ticket in more detail. This should happen soon after a ticket is issued - ideally in the first 2-5 working days after the issue entered your tracker. This gives the ticket issuer the confidence that they are heard - and increases their inclination to continue making issues. Many people have been known to stop creating issues just because they thought no one was listening!
1. Do not close tickets just because you don't like them - closing ticket without allowing the issuer to come to a conclusion is rude by all standards. If you think a ticket is out of scope for a repository, recommend to move it to a different repo.
1. To guarantee the above, make sure that you don't only have an issue tracker, but you have someone who is responsible for triaging requests.

"Responsiveness" is a key quality of our general collaborative spirit.

Review Criteria
-------
The developers of the ontology need to include a statement specifying how they are planning to respond the ontology requests, such as via a GitHub tracker and/or mailing list. 

Examples
--------

Issue tracker: https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo/issues  
Discussion list: mondo-users@googlegroups.com  
Collaboration of this sort can be demonstrated by having an active discussion mailing list, or responsiveness to community requests on a GitHub tracker.
