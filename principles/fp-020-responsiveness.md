title: Responsiveness (principle 20)
---

NOTE
-------
The wording of this principle is still in progress.

Summary
-------
Ontology developers MUST offer channels for community participation and be responsive to requests. 

[This check is automatically validated.](checks/fp_020)

Purpose
-------
Ontology development benefits from community input, which is strongly encouraged by the OBO Foundry. Accordingly, "responsiveness" is a key quality of our general collaborative spirit. This principle is intended to guide the processes to ensure community responsiveness. 

Recommendation
------- 
Ontology developers SHOULD aim for a good level of responsiveness to community requests and suggestions.

Expectations of responsiveness:
1. Issues are contributions - and should be met by a thankful attitude. When receiving a ticket on your issue tracker, the first thing to do is thank the contributor, even if a ticket cannot be addressed right away. 
1. If aa ticket cannot be addressed right away, eplain when you plan to look at the ticket in more detail. This should happen soon after a ticket is issued - ideally in the first 2-5 working days after the issue entered your tracker. 
1. Please do not close tickets without responding. If a ticket is out of scope for a repository, recommend moving it to a different repository.
1. It is recommended that someone from each ontology is responsible for triaging issues and requests.

Implementation
-------
A discussion mailing list and issue tracker are required to obtain an OBO Foundry PURL. The OBO Foundry offers the following recommendations on the responsiveness in issue trackers (GitHub is recommended).

1. Establish an issue tracker (GitHub is recommended).
2. Establish a mailing list (For example, google groups).
3. The issue tracker and mailing list MUST be monitored and responded to in a reasonable amount of time (ideally 2-5 working days).

Review Criteria
-------
The developers of the ontology need to include a statement specifying how they are planning to respond the ontology requests, such as via a GitHub tracker and/or mailing list. 

Examples
--------

Issue tracker: https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo/issues  

Discussion list: mondo-users@googlegroups.com  

Collaboration of this sort can be demonstrated by having an active discussion mailing list, or responsiveness to community requests on a GitHub tracker.
